# Twitter Project

The goal of this project is to collect and analyze data obtained through APIs. The broad question answered is whether there is a relationship between language fractionalization and economic growth. This analysis builds upon the work by Alesina et al (2003), a classic study in the political economy field, which developed a new index to measure ethnic, linguistic, and religious fragmentation at the country level. The project collects geolocated tweets (Part A) and then computes the index of language fractionalization to see whether the results match with Alesina et al's prior work (Part B). Then, using the World Bank API to collect country-level indicators of economic growth, we explore whether they are correlated with variation in language fragmentation (Part C).
