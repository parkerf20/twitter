# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Assignment 3
---

The goal of this problem set (which will be marked!) is to practice collecting and analyzing data obtained through APIs. The broad question you will try to answer is whether there is a relationship between language fractionalization and economic growth. Your analysis will build upon the work by Alesina et al (2003), a classic study in the political economy field, which developed a new index to measure ethnic, linguistic, and religious fragmentation at the country level. You will collect geolocated tweets and then compute the index of language fractionalization to see whether your results match with prior work. Then, you will interact with the World Bank API to collect country-level indicators of economic growth, which will allow you to explore whether they are correlated with variation in language fragmentation.

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. Remember that we will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown files (in .html format). You can add your responses in italics so that it's easier for us to read them.

This is a group assignment.  You can choose your own group, or if this proves difficult, we will assign groups.  Groups should consist of 4 people or fewer.  The assignment should name the group and its members very clearly, and one account can be used to coordinate the submission.  The owner of the account can share their private account with the other group members' GitHub usernames.

Note that this is an ambitious assignment, but it is broken down into very clearly delineated, separate questions.  You can use the group to divide up the labour, or work on each part separately, as you wish.  GitHub should facilitate this form of distributed work.

Submissions without an html file will receive 0 points.
